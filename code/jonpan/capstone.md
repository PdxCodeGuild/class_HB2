Capstone Proposal

Name: Project Metascape

Project Overview: Display "cool" data on a rotating globe in a browser

- What are the major features of your web application? Display geocoding data in an interesting way 
- What problem is it attempting to solve? Discover if a globe visualization of certian data will be more persuasive than reading data in an excel sheet 
- What libraries or frameworks will you use? Globe Data Visualization using ThreeJS/WebGL (https://github.com/vasturiano/globe.gl). 

Functionality:

- What will they see on each page? Index page will have a globe (probably rotating), with no data
- What can they input and click and see? Fields/buttons will allow the user to select different slices of data 
- How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end? I envision something like modifying the fields/buttons mentioned above will modify the json file, which changes what the globe does


Data Model: Depends on what data I end up using, so far government data seems the most easily accessible. Something like if a certain region voted Republican or Democrat measured via color and then the length of a line on the point could be average income - this could be interesting.

Schedule:
-Week 1/Milestone 1: Get globe/index.html working with static json file
-Week 2/Milestone 2: Experiment with different data / models and pick the most visually appealing/relevant data - then create models from it
-Week 3/Milestone 3: Add fields/buttons on index.html to customize json file and then reload the page
-Week 4/Milestone 4: CSS, make everything look better
